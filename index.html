        <h2 style="color:yellow">1) What is World Wide Web?</h2>
        <img align="right" src="https://static.javatpoint.com/seo/images/world-wide-web.png" width=200 height=200>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWorld Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the retrieval and display of text and media to your device. The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called "hypertext" or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related pieces of information so that users can access the desired information quickly. Hypertext offers the advantage to select a word or phrase from text and thus to access other pages that provide additional information related to that word or phrase.<br>
<br>
A web page is given an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of web pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website, e.g www.youtube.com, www.google.com, etc. So, the World Wide Web is like a huge electronic book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the world. Small websites store all of their WebPages on a single server, but big websites or organizations place their WebPages on different servers in different countries so that when users of a country search their site they could get the information quickly from the nearest server.<br>
<br>
So, the web provides a communication platform for users to retrieve and exchange information over the internet. Unlike a book, where we move from one page to another in a sequence, on World Wide Web we follow a web of hypertext links to visit a web page and from that web page to move to other web pages. You need a browser, which is installed on your computer, to access the Web.<br>

<h2 style="color:yellow">2) History of World Wide Web</h2>
<p>
<img align="right" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WokD3LugyTW5sqNI6ebJg2eKQUw=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19406365/1178895878.jpg.jpg" width=150 height=150>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The World Wide Web was invented by a British scientist, Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He was working at CERN at that time. Originally, it was developed by him to fulfill the need of automated information sharing between scientists across the world, so that they could easily share the data and results of their experiments and studies with each other. CERN, where Tim Berners worked, is a community of more than 1700 scientists from more than 100 countries. These scientists spend some time on CERN site, and rest of the time they work at their universities and national laboratories in their home countries, so there was a need for reliable communication tools so that they can exchange information.<br>
<br>
Internet and Hypertext were available at this time, but no one thought how to use the internet to link or share one document to another. Tim focused on three main technologies that could make computers understand each other, HTML, URL, and HTTP. So, the objective behind the invention of WWW was to combine recent computer technologies, data networks, and hypertext into a user-friendly and effective global information system.

<h2 style="color:yellow">3) Components of WWW</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>Uniform Resource Locator (URL): serves as system for resources on web.</li>
      <li>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): specifies communication of browser and server.</i>
      <li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML): defines structure, organisation and content of webpage.</li>
   </ul>
<h2 style="color:yellow">4) Most Commonly Used URL's</h2>
     <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.google.com" style="text-decoration:none;color:white" >www.google.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" style="text-decoration:none;color:white">www.youtube.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/" style="text-decoration:none;color:white">www.microsoft.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/" style="text-decoration:none;color:white">www.apple.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" style="text-decoration:none;color:white">www.linkedin.com</a></li>
     </ul>
<h2 style="color:yellow">5) Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp HTML is a standard markup language which is used for creating web pages. It describes the structure of web pages through HTML elements or tags. These tags are used to organize the pieces of content such as 'heading,' 'paragraph,' 'table,' 'Image,' and more. You don't see HTML tags when you open a webpage as browsers don't display the tags and use them only to render the content of a web page. In simple words, HTML is used to display text, images, and other resources through a Web browser.
In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.
Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5. <br>
<br> 
It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified. It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags. It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages, so it enhances the interest of browsing of the user. It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages which makes it more attractive and interactive.

<h2 style="color:yellow">6) Web Browser and HTTP</h2>
<p><img  src="https://static.javatpoint.com/seo/images/web-browser.png" width=350><br>
<br>
A web browser, which is commonly known as a browser, is a program that displays text, data, pictures, videos, animation, and more. It provides a software interface that allows you to click hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web. When you double click the Browser icon installed on your computer to launch it, you get connected to the World Wide Web and can search Google or type a URL into the address bar.
In the beginning, browsers were used only for browsing due to their limited potential. Today, they are more advanced; along with browsing you can use them for e-mailing, transferring multimedia files, using social media sites, and participating in online discussion groups and more. Some of the commonly used browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and more <br>

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol which enables WWW to work smoothly and effectively. It is based on a client-server model. The client is a web browser which communicates with the web server which hosts the website. This protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and what actions the Web Server and browser should take in response to different commands. When you enter a URL in the browser, an HTTP command is sent to the Web server, and it transmits the requested Web Page.<br>
<br>
 When we open a website using a browser, a connection to the web server is opened, and the browser communicates with the server through HTTP and sends a request. HTTP is carried over TCP/IP to communicate with the server. The server processes the browser's request and sends a response, and then the connection is closed. Thus, the browser retrieves content from the server for the user.
